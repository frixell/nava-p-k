# Contact & Home Styling Notes

## Contact Page Assets
- The SCSS entry `src/styles/components/contact/_index.scss` (and its `_page.scss`, `_strip.scss`) still drive layout for `ContactStrip`, `ContactFollow`, etc.
- When migrating contact components to Emotion, remove the `@import './components/contact/index';` line from `styles.scss` and delete the SCSS folder.
- `ContactPage` itself has been simplified to just render `ContactStrip` and `Footer`; once the contact components are in Emotion, the container can be reworked much like `AboutPage`.

## Home Page
- The `HomePage` container still references legacy mapping UI (MapViewTest, PointTest, etc.) and depends on `_HomePage.scss` for structure.
- Removed components such as HomePageCarousel/HomePagePleased/HomePageIntouch can be ignored going forward; clean up any residual CSS selectors when the homepage is migrated to Emotion.
- Navigation/header/footer already share the new layout primitives; Home is the major remaining class-based page after this cleanup.

## Next Steps
1. Convert `ContactStrip`, `ContactFollow`, and `ContactContact` to functional TypeScript components with Emotion styles.
2. Extract shared layout tokens (spacing, typography) when porting the contact and home pages to keep styling consistent.
3. Contact migration completeâ€”SCSS imports removed. Next, focus moves to Home page (`_HomePage.scss`).

## Home Page Migration Checklist
- `HomePage.js` imports legacy map helpers (`MapViewTest`, `PointTest`, etc.) and SCSS selectors from `_HomePage.scss`.
- Supporting containers still in use: `SideBar.js`, `ProjectDetailsPage.js`, `MapViewTest.js`; determine which legacy helpers (e.g., mapping tests) can be archived after confirming no routes rely on them.
- Map rendering runs through ArcGIS (esri-loader) in `MapViewTest.js`; assess effort to wrap it in hooks/components or replace with modern map lib.
- Redux actions required: `startAddPoint`, `startEditProject`, category mutations; ensure TypeScript definitions exist before migrating.
- Styling: `_HomePage.scss` controls sidebar, social, modal layout; translate to Emotion and inline tokens similar to About/Contact.
- After migration, prune unused imports (e.g., `AutosizeInput`, `Modal` replacements) and remove `_HomePage.scss`.
